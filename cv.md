### Briefly About Myself:
In 2005 I started my career as a graphic designer in an advertising studio. At the same time, I stayed to teach at the university in the department of advertising, and also worked as an editor and host of an entertainment program on television.

In the process of working in the media, I got acquainted with web design and such popular SMS as Drupal, Jumla, Wordpress. I began to create sites both on these engines and on platforms like Tilda and Wix.

Now I'm studying to be a front-end developer. I am sure that I will go this way and become a professional.
